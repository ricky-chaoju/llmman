"""End-to-end tests against a real `llmman` binary.

Unlike the rest of this directory (which stubs `llmman`, monkeypatches
`_patch.resolve`, or never constructs a real `ModelConfig`), these tests
call this plugin's real public surface (`_llmman_cli.resolve()`,
`_patch._make_patched()`) against a real `llmman` binary and a real
registry pull — same "no mocks" reasoning as `tests/launch_e2e.rs`.

Gated behind the `e2e` pytest marker (excluded by default via
`pyproject.toml`'s `addopts`); run explicitly with:

    pytest -m e2e -v

CI runs this in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `e2e` job, right after
`cargo test --test launch_e2e`, on Linux x86_64/aarch64 and macOS
aarch64. That ordering matters for the two lightweight tests below:
`launch_e2e.rs`'s `warm_model()` has already pulled `MODEL` into the
default store, so `resolve()` here hits a warm cache instead of a
second ~740MB download. The `vllm serve` test pays its own separate
pull instead (see its own docstring). That test runs on vLLM's CPU
platform on Linux and vllm-metal's Metal-GPU platform on macOS (see
ci.yml's "Install vLLM (e2e)" step).

Every test here skips (not fails) when its own prerequisite (`llmman`,
`vllm`) isn't available, same as `tests/launch_e2e.rs`.

    Deliberately never calls `_llmman_cli.resolve()`/`llmman resolve`
    directly: the point is proving vLLM's own plugin loading discovers
    and installs this package's hook on its own, and that constructing a
    real `ModelConfig` for an `oci://` reference during vLLM's own

    Two different real backends here, same test, same assertions:

    - Linux: vLLM's own CPU platform. `--dtype bfloat16`: a hard
      requirement, not just a preference — Qwen3.5's CPU Gated DeltaNet
      kernel asserts BF16 and crashes on a real forward pass with
      float16 (which still loads and passes `/health` fine).
      `--enforce-eager`: skips CUDA-graph startup work that doesn't
      apply on CPU.
    - macOS: vllm-metal's Metal-GPU platform (see ci.yml's "Install vLLM
      (e2e)" step) instead of vLLM's own CPU backend, which hung
      indefinitely on macOS CI runners regardless of `--dtype`. Flags/

      `--enforce-eager`; `--max-num-seqs 1` plus
      `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.8` bound GDN linear-attention state
