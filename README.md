<p align="center"><b>Run any agent on any model.</b></p>

<p align="center">
Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode and friends, pointed at a model
running on your own machine, or at any hosted provider, in one command.
</p>

```
llmman launch claude --model qwen3.8
```

That starts a local inference server, fetches the tested `llama.cpp` release for
your GPU (as a container on Linux with Docker or Podman, otherwise a prebuilt
binary), loads the model, and execs an agent against it.

</p>

Models are OCI images, so moving one takes no tooling you don't already have:

```
llmman transfer hf.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-0.8B-GGUF docker.io/owner/model:latest
```

That copies from Hugging Face into your own registry directly, without a copy
landing in your local store.

## Why llmman?

- **Provider agnostic.** The same `launch`, `run` and `list` commands work
  against a local model or any hosted provider (`--provider baseten`,
  `--provider groq`, ...). One endpoint, one agent config, local or hosted.
- **Registry agnostic.** `llmman run qwen3.8` pulls straight from Docker
  Hub; `llmman run hf.co/org/model` pulls straight from Hugging Face. Or
  package a model as a plain OCI artifact and push it to GHCR, quay, Harbor
  or a self-hosted mirror, then `llmman run` it from there. No curated
  library, no account with llmman, no gatekeeper.
- **Vanilla everything.** Upstream `llama.cpp` releases (or the
  `llama-server` already on your `PATH`), `vllm`, `sglang` and `mlx-lm` as-is, serving
  unmodified GGUF and safetensors files. No fork to wait on, no import step,
  no private blob format: the store is a standard OCI Image Layout that all
  can read.
- **One-step transfer.** Any source `pull` understands paired with any OCI
  registry destination, optionally signed, without a copy in your local store.
  That is the shape air-gapped and compliance-bound environments need.
- **Pool your machines.** Several `llmman serve` daemons form an
  [aggregation](#aggregation): name the others, and a request to any of
  them runs on whichever node has the model loaded or the most room for
  it. A laptop, a workstation and a Spark look like one endpoint.

## Install

**Linux, macOS:**

```
curl -fsSL https://llmmanorg.github.io/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```
irm https://llmmanorg.github.io/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Homebrew:**

```sh
brew install llmmanorg/tap/llmman
```

**winget:**

```powershell
winget install llmmanorg.llmman
```

**Cargo:**

```sh
cargo binstall llmman   # prebuilt binary
cargo install llmman    # build from source; needs Go 1.25+ (and LLVM on Windows) as well as Rust
```

**Android** (the web UI over an on-device daemon, see [docs/android.md](docs/android.md)):
`llmman-aarch64-linux-android.apk` from the [latest release](https://github.com/llmmanorg/llmman/releases/latest).

**Container** (llmman in the llama.cpp server image, see [docs/backends.md](docs/backends.md#in-a-container)):

```sh
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:17434:17434 -e LLMMAN_API_KEYS=<key> -v llmman:/root/.local/share/llmman --entrypoint llmman ai/llmman serve
```

## Quick start

Three commands cover most of it:

```sh
llmman launch claude --model qwen3.8  # an agent on a local model
llmman run qwen3.8                    # just chat with a model
llmman serve                          # an Ollama/OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible endpoint
```

Run `llmman launch` with no arguments to see the supported agents and whether
each is installed. Want a hosted model instead of a local one? Every command
above takes `--provider`; see [Hosted providers](#hosted-providers). Want both
at once, picked per request? See [Hybrid model pairs](#hybrid-model-pairs).

### Generate images, video and audio

A diffusion model repository works like any other: `run` pulls the transformer, its VAEs, the text
projection and the text encoder it was trained with.

```sh
llmman run unsloth/LTX-2.3-GGUF "Draw a cat"                              # Image saved to: draw-a-cat-<timestamp>.png
llmman run unsloth/LTX-2.3-GGUF --video --seconds 2 "waves on a beach"   # an mp4 with an audio track (needs ffmpeg)
llmman run unsloth/LTX-2.3-GGUF --audio --seconds 3 "a cat purring"      # a 48 kHz stereo wav
```

Without a prompt it opens a `>>> ` loop where `/set width|height|steps|seed|cfg|negative|seconds|media`
adjusts the settings. The same model answers `/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/videos` and
`/v1/audio/speech` on `llmman serve`.

Diffusion repositories published as Diffusers-layout safetensors (a root `model_index.json`)
are instead served by [vLLM-Omni](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni) (`vllm serve
--omni`; install `vllm-omni` next to `vllm`, or use `--runtime docker` for the `vllm/vllm-omni` image).
See [docs/backends.md](docs/backends.md#vllm-omni-diffusers-pipelines).

## OCI-native models

Models are packaged as standard OCI artifacts and stored in any compatible
registry: Docker Hub, GHCR, quay, Harbor, self-hosted. There is no curated
library and no gatekeeper: push a model anywhere you can push a container
image, and anyone can `llmman run` it straight from there.

That means the registry, mirroring, access control, retention and
signing infrastructure you already run for containers works for models
too. Pull from the registry you already trust, `transfer` a model from
Hugging Face into your own registry without it ever touching a laptop,
and sign it with cosign so `pull` can refuse anything unsigned.

### Pull a model

```
llmman pull qwen3.8
```

### Transfer a model between locations

Transfer an image directly from a source to a destination without adding it
to your local store, e.g. HuggingFace straight to an OCI registry:

```
llmman transfer hf.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-0.8B-GGUF docker.io/owner/model:latest
```

Any source `llmman pull` understands (an OCI registry, `hf://`, `ms://`, ...) can be paired with any OCI registry destination.

### Sign a model, and verify what you pull

No gatekeeper means nothing vouches for a model implicitly, so llmman
verifies the artifact rather than trusting the hub. Signatures are
[cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)-format, so `cosign verify`
reads what llmman writes and the check works the same on Docker Hub,
GHCR, quay, or an air-gapped mirror.

```
llmman push docker.io/myorg/mymodel:v1 --sign-key signing.key
llmman verify docker.io/myorg/mymodel:v1 --key signing.pub
```

A `[verify]` trust policy turns that into an automatic check on every
`pull`, warning or refusing outright per repository. Off by default —
there is nothing to check against until you have said whom you trust.
See [docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md).

### Compared with Ollama

Ollama stores models in its own blob layout behind its own registry
protocol; llmman uses the OCI standard end to end, so the model
supply chain looks like the container supply chain:

| | llmman | Ollama |
|---|---|---|
| Model registry | Hugging Face directly, or any OCI registry (Docker Hub, GHCR, quay, Harbor, self-hosted) | ollama.com library, own registry protocol |
| Model format on disk | Unmodified GGUF / safetensors in a standard OCI Image Layout | GGUF and safetensors imported via `Modelfile` into Ollama's blob layout |
| Registry-to-registry transfer | `llmman transfer hf.co/... docker.io/...` in one step, nothing added to your local store | Pull, write a `Modelfile`, `create`, push to ollama.com |
| Signing and verification | cosign-format signatures; `verify` command and per-repo pull-time trust policy | None |
| Inference engine | Upstream `llama.cpp` release, or your own `llama-server`; `vllm`; `sglang`; `mlx-lm` | Bundled `llama.cpp`/ggml fork plus Ollama's own engine |
| Hosted models | Any provider via `--provider` | Ollama Cloud |
| Multiple machines | Aggregation: daemons pool hardware, any node answers for all | One host per endpoint |

## Serve

```
llmman serve
```

One endpoint on `127.0.0.1:17434` that speaks Ollama, OpenAI and Anthropic:

| API | Endpoints |
|-----|-----------|
| Ollama | `/api/chat`, `/api/generate`, `/api/embed`, `/api/tags`, `/api/ps`, `/api/pull`, `/api/push`, `/api/create`, ... |
| OpenAI | `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/audio/transcriptions` |
| Anthropic | `/v1/messages` |

So any existing client works unchanged:

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:17434 ollama run unsloth/Qwen3.5-0.8B-GGUF
```

Models load on demand, each in its own backend process, and unload after
five idle minutes (`keep_alive`, as in Ollama). GGUF is served by upstream
[`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) at a pinned release —
in a Docker/Podman container, as a downloaded prebuilt binary, or from
`PATH`, whichever `--runtime` picks ([docs/backends.md](docs/backends.md#choosing-a-runtime));
safetensors by
[`vllm`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), by
[`sglang`](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) with
`LLMMAN_SAFETENSORS_ENGINE=sglang`, or by
[`mlx-lm`](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm) on macOS
(installed for you when the daemon starts). Tool
calling, vision, structured output, embeddings (GGUF) and the Responses
API (what Codex speaks) all work; there is a [web UI](docs/webui.md) at
`/` (chat with any local or hosted model, generate images, video and
audio with a diffusion model, and a terminal) and an optional Prometheus
`/metrics`.

The full endpoint list and per-API notes are in [docs/api.md](docs/api.md);
backend selection in [docs/backends.md](docs/backends.md); bind address,
context length, keep-alive and the other daemon settings in
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

### Aggregation

Several machines each running `llmman serve` can pool their hardware — a
group of manatees is an aggregation. Name the others on each node and a
request to any of them is served by whichever has the model loaded, or
the most room to load it:

```
llmman config set aggregation.peers asahi,spark
llmman config set auth.api_keys <shared-key>
LLMMAN_HOST=0.0.0.0 llmman serve
```

`llmman ps`, `/api/tags` and `/v1/models` then show the whole
aggregation, and `llmman stop` reaches a model wherever it was loaded.
Nothing is elected and nothing is shared: every node is a whole llmman
that knows the others' addresses. See [docs/aggregation.md](docs/aggregation.md).

A daemon the network can reach requires an API key on every request
(`LLMMAN_API_KEYS`, or `auth.api_keys` as above; the CLI sends
`LLMMAN_API_KEY`) unless `LLMMAN_AUTH=off`, and can terminate TLS itself
with `LLMMAN_TLS_CERT`/`LLMMAN_TLS_KEY`. See [docs/api.md](docs/api.md#authentication).

## Launch an integration

Point an integration at a model in one step. `llmman launch` starts `serve`
in the background if it isn't already running (preloading a local
model), then sets the right environment variables and execs the
integration:

```
llmman launch claude --model qwen3.8
llmman launch agy --model qwen3.8 -- -p "Explain this repository"
llmman launch grok --model qwen3.8 -- -p "Explain this repository"
```

Run `llmman launch` with no arguments to list the supported integrations
(Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Pi, Aider, Qwen Code, Gemini CLI, Grok Build,
AGY, DeepSeek Harness, ...) and whether each is installed. Installing an
integration is up to you; llmman only execs what is already on your
machine. `dsh` runs under `npx` when it isn't installed globally. Any extra
arguments after `--` are forwarded to the integration's own CLI. Short
names work wherever a model reference is accepted.

AGY requires version 1.1.13 or newer for Gemini API-key and custom-endpoint
support. llmman writes Gemini mode to its own stable settings directory at
`~/.gemini/llmman/`; your AGY settings stay untouched.

### Hosted providers

`--provider` points llmman at a model it doesn't serve itself, from
`launch`, from `run`, and from `list`:

```sh
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
llmman providers                                    # which providers, and is the key set
llmman list --provider openrouter                   # its models, and $/Mtok in and out
llmman run --provider openrouter qwen/qwen3-coder   # chat with one directly
llmman launch opencode --provider openrouter --model qwen/qwen3-coder
```

The provider list comes from [models.dev](https://models.dev), the same
catalog `opencode` uses, so a new provider works without an llmman
release. Requests still go through `llmman serve`; `--provider` changes
where the daemon forwards them, not who the client talks to, so a local
and a hosted model are one endpoint and one integration config. The key
travels per request; it is never written into an integration's config.

Which integrations support `--provider`, where the key comes from, and
why it is only ever sent to a loopback daemon are in
[docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md).

### Hybrid model pairs

`--overflow-provider` and `--overflow-model` name a hosted model that
takes over when a request is too large for the local `--model`, with
`llmman serve` picking a side per request:

```sh
llmman launch opencode --model gemma4 --overflow-provider anthropic --overflow-model claude-sonnet-5
llmman run gemma4 --overflow-provider anthropic --overflow-model claude-sonnet-5
```

A request pinned with `x-llmman-route: local` or `cloud` goes where it
says; otherwise one too large for the local model's context goes to the
provider, and everything else stays on this machine. The pair travels as
one ordinary model name, `llmman.hybrid/gemma4,anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`,
so it works from any client on every inference endpoint. Details in
[docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md#hybrid-model-pairs).
